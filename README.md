# Stock-Portfolio-Optimizer

For those who are lookinh to otpmize their stock portfolios. The prgram created will analyze whatever stocks you have and tell you what percentage of your portfolio should be alloted to that stock. 
the code will return your expected anaual return, volitility ( as decmials and you convert it to a percentage) as well as the sharpe ratio for the poortfilio the stock suggests you create. the program also takes it onestep further. it will ask you how much you want to invest you type in the value. It will then tell you how many shares of each stock you can buy given the protfilo it suggested, and the amount of money you want to invest.

How to use the code: 

1) First and foremost this code uses YahooFianance as the database. Therefore if you are looking for Canadian stocks they MUST all end in .TO otherwise the program will not understand what you are looking for.
   for example if you are looking for the Candian version of Suncor. You would type in SU.TO NOT SU.

2) if you are looking for US stocks then just the ticker will do. For example, Nivida is just NVDA

3) the code is interactive so it will ask you questions and provide  instructions so if you have half a brain follow it and the code will work just fine.
